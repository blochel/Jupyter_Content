    "This notebook is based on [chapter 2 of Jake VanderPlas' Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/02.00-introduction-to-numpy.html). [<img src=\"images/PDSH-cover-small.png\" alt=\"PDSH Cover Image\" style=\"width: 50px;float:right\"/>](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/02.00-introduction-to-numpy.html)\n",

    "> This chapter, along with [chapter 3](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/03.00-introduction-to-pandas.html), outlines techniques for effectively loading, storing, and manipulating in-memory data in Python. The topic is very broad: datasets can come from a wide range of sources and a wide range of formats, including be collections of documents, collections of images, collections of sound clips, collections of numerical measurements, or nearly anything else. **Despite this apparent heterogeneity, it will help us to think of all data fundamentally as arrays of numbers.**\n",
    "\n",
    "> For example, images–particularly **digital images**–can be thought of as simply two-dimensional arrays of numbers representing pixel brightness across the area. **Sound clips** can be thought of as one-dimensional arrays of intensity versus time. **Text** can be converted in various ways into numerical representations, perhaps binary digits representing the frequency of certain words or pairs of words. **No matter what the data are, the first step in making it analyzable will be to transform them into arrays of numbers.** (We will discuss some specific examples of this process later in [Feature Engineering](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/05.04-feature-engineering.html))\n",
    "\n",
    "> For this reason, efficient storage and manipulation of numerical arrays is absolutely fundamental to the process of doing data science. We'll now take a look at the specialized tools that Python has for handling such numerical arrays: the NumPy package, and the Pandas package (discussed in Chapter 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "> This chapter will cover NumPy in detail. NumPy (short for **Numerical Python**) provides an efficient interface to store and operate on dense data buffers. In some ways, NumPy arrays are like Python's built-in list type, but **NumPy arrays provide much more efficient storage and data operations as the arrays grow larger in size.** NumPy arrays form the core of nearly the entire ecosystem of data science tools in Python, so time spent learning to use NumPy effectively will be valuable no matter what aspect of data science interests you.\n",

    "## Understanding Data Types in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "As we've mentioned earlier, Python is **dynamically typed**. This flexibility can be handy, but, especially as sizes of datasets grow, if becomes a liability.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the PDSH chapter points out, languages such as C and Java are **statically typed**, meaning that the programmer has to declare, when the variable is created, the type of data that the variable will store.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example in C, you could make a loop like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C\n",
    "/* C code */\n",
    "int result = 0;\n",
    "for(int i=0; i<100; i++){\n",
    "    result += i;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "While in Python the same thing is done like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# Python code\n",
    "result = 0\n",
    "for i in range(100):\n",
    "    result += i\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that in C, the data types, all `int`s in the example, is explicitly declared, while in Python it is dynamically inferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Python Integer is More Than Just and Integer\n",
    "\n",
    "We also briefly saw in the Intro to Jupyter session that a lot of the underlying code for Python is actually written in C (that is why the `??` function can't always display the code for a function). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the Intro to Python session, we learned about Object Oriented Programming, and that everything in Python is an object--even strings and integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this leads to the reality that if we do something like `x=1000`, `x` is not just a \"raw\" integer--bits stored in memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "> It's actually a pointer to a compound C structure, which contains several values. Looking through the Python 3.4 source code, we find that the integer (long) type definition effectively looks like this (once the C macros are expanded):\n",
    "\n",
    "```C\n",
    "struct _longobject {\n",
    "    long ob_refcnt;\n",
    "    PyTypeObject *ob_type;\n",
    "    size_t ob_size;\n",
    "    long ob_digit[1];\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "> A single integer in Python 3.4 actually contains four pieces:\n",
    "> * `ob_refcnt`, a reference count that helps Python silently handle memory allocation and deallocation\n",
    "> * `ob_type`, which encodes the type of the variable\n",
    "> * `ob_size`, which specifies the size of the following data members\n",
    "ob_digit, which contains the actual integer value that we expect the Python variable to represent.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This means that there is some overhead in storing an integer in Python as compared to an integer in a compiled language like C, as illustrated in the following figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "> Here `PyObject_HEAD` is the part of the structure containing the reference count, type code, and other pieces mentioned before.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Notice the difference here: **a C integer is essentially a label for a position in memory whose bytes encode an integer value**. **A Python integer is a pointer to a position in memory containing all the Python object information**, including the bytes that contain the integer value. This extra information in the Python integer structure is what allows Python to be coded so freely and dynamically. All this additional information in Python types comes at a cost, however, which becomes especially apparent in structures that combine many of these objects."

What they use is a complex series of manipulations to generate numbers that appear random, sometimes called *pseudorandom*. If you start with the same number, the seed, the sequence of \"random\" numbers generated is **guaranteed** to be identical. This has good and bad properties. On the good side, we can set a seed and all have the same numbers, you can also use this for troubleshooting, etc. On the bad side, we are often lulled into a false sense of having simulated something repeatedly only to find that we failed to consider the biases that may be introduced by the random number generator--or worse, repeatedly simulating something using the same seed!\n",

The key to making it fast is to use vectorized operations, generally implemented through NumPy's universal functions (ufuncs).

It then introduces many of the most common and useful arithmetic ufuncs available in the NumPy package.\n",
